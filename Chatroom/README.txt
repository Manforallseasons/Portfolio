I know the submission page says to create seperate folders for the server and client, but there's only two java files total, 
in the src folder, and I don't wanna risk ruining things by including new folders that weren't there when I was working. 
Hopefully, the files 'server.java' and 'client.java' are intuitive enough that this oversight can be forgiven. 

I didn't include direct messaging or special images, since both were optional and time constraints are forcing me to focus on other work.

Make sure the server is running first, and then run the client. Enter the IP Address of the computer running the server. If it's 
running on your own computer, just use 127.0.0.1

I didn't have any other computers to work with, since I did the project by myself, so no guarentees about how well it works 
on other systems. 

After you've entered the IP Address and connected, enter a username. It must be shorter than 20 characters.

The top bar at the top of the screen is the text field. Type something in and hit 'enter' to send messages. Hit 
the X button in the top right to close the client. 

I was able to run several applications on the same system and have them be considered seperate, which is nice.
